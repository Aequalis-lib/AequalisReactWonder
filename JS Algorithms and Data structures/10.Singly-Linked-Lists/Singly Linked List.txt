Singly Linked List 
	-> A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
	
Array Vs  List
	List
	--------
	-> Do not have indexes
	-> Connected via nodes with a next pointers
	-> Random access is not allowed
	
	Arrays
	---------
	Indexed in order
	Insertion and deletion can be expensive
	Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
