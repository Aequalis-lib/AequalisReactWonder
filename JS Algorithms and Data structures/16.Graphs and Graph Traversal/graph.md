- A graph is nonlinear data structure that contains nodes and edges.
- A node(Vertex) is single Unique value
- An edge is a connection between two of the nodes

### Some type of graphs

- Directed Graph - It goes in a one way.
- Undirected Graph - It goes in both ways.
- Weighted graph - Node have additional data about the relationship.

### Some companies using Graph

- Google maps
- netflix
- twitter

## Some Uses of graphs:

- Social networks
- Location / mapping
- Routing algorithms
- Visual hierarchy
- File system optimizations

## Representing a graph

### Adjacency matrix :

### Adjacency List :

![Adjacency List](/assets/AdjacencyList.png "Adjacency matrix")

### Adjacency List vs Adjacency Matrix

### Adding a Vertex

### Adding an Edge

![Adjacency List](/assets/addEdge.png "Adding an Edge")

### Removing an Edge

## Graph Traversal

- Tree is a subset of grahph.
- When we write the code to traverse a graph, we need to specify our starting point.

### Graph traversal uses

- Peer to peer networking
- Web Crawlers
- Finding "closest" matches / recommendations
- Shortest path problems
  - GPS Navigation
  - Solving mazes
  - AI (Shortest path to win a game)

#### Depth First Search

- DFS recursively
- DFS Iterative

#### Breadth First Search
